Data Analysis project surrounding the injuries of previous NBA players and comparing stats from before and after.

## Introduction
After Golden State Warriors lost Klay Thompson, ACL tear, and Kevin Durant, ruptured achilles tendon, in the 2019 NBA Finals, the 2019 offseason showed that the NBA teams were still willing to offer Max contracts to both players knowing that there may be a chance that they both do not come back the same. I want to look further at the careers of NBA players before and after their injuries to see if the risk is worth the results.
